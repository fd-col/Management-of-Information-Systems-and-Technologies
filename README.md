# Management of Information Systems and Technologies

**Course at:** Universidade Lusófona

**Professor:** Paulo Guedes

Welcome to my project repository for the "**Management of Information Systems and Technologies**" course at **Universidade Lusófona**, created by **Federico Colleluori** and **Alejandra Riscos**. This course explores the integration of technology and business, focusing on **IT management**, **operational strategies**, and **global alignment**. 

Below is a brief overview of what the course covers:

* _Information Systems Management_: Understanding the role of IT in business and aligning IT with organizational goals.
* _Operational Management_: Team organization, financial management, KPIs, and lean practices for IT teams.
* _Transversal Management_: Risk management, portfolio management, supplier relations, and process improvement.
* _Global Management_: Strategic planning, budgeting, communication, and ensuring IT supports long-term business objectives.

Through the projects in this repository, I’ve applied the concepts of **IT management**, **business alignment**, and **operational effectiveness** to real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore, give feedback, or ask questions!
